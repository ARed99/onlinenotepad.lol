          <h3>Rich Text Editing</h3>
          <p>
            Tying yourself to the mast by standardising on one tool, and not
            only that, but a plain text tool, means your data will live forever,
            and the network effect can make it more and more valuable over time,
            instead of less and less. Teams of people need to be on the same
            page. Both literally and figuratively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The natural way to do this is by talking to one another. But talking
            does not scale, and is extremely impermanent. After the sound waves

            sound waves have bounced off the walls and reverberated for a
            second. After the sound waves have bounced off the walls and

            After the sound waves have bounced off the walls and reverberated
            for a second... the words are gone, and what is left is our memory
            of them. Human memory is extremely unreliable, subjective, and the
            root cause of many problems. After a discussion, it is not apparent
            that everyone has agreed upon exactly the same thing.
