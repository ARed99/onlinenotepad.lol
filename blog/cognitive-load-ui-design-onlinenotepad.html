        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In today's fast-paced digital landscape, efficient information
          processing is essential for productivity and focus. Cognitive Load
          Theory (CLT) provides valuable insights into how our cognitive
          resources are managed during learning and information processing.

          is designed with these principles in mind, creating an intuitive user
          interface that minimizes extraneous cognitive load and enhances the
          user experience. This article explores how OnlineNotepad.lol’s design
          choices align with CLT to optimize mental resources for effective
          note-taking.

        <h2>Understanding Cognitive Load Theory</h2>
        <p>
          Cognitive Load Theory, developed by John Sweller, posits that our
          working memory has a limited capacity. When cognitive load exceeds
          this capacity, learning and performance are hindered. CLT identifies
          three types of cognitive load: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane.
          Effective user interface design aims to manage these loads,
          particularly extraneous cognitive load, which can be minimized through
          thoughtful design choices.
