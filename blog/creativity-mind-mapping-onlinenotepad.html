        <h2>What is Mind Mapping?</h2>
        <p>
          Mind mapping is a visual tool used to organize ideas in a non-linear
          way, helping individuals and teams brainstorm, structure information,
          and uncover new insights. By representing thoughts and ideas visually,
          it encourages free thinking and allows for the exploration of concepts
          that might not emerge through traditional note-taking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mind maps typically start with a central concept or question, with
          related ideas branching out. This method not only enhances creativity
          but also improves memory retention and helps generate new connections
          between ideas. OnlineNotepad.lol provides a versatile environment to
          create mind maps digitally, offering tools to structure and expand on
          ideas dynamically.
