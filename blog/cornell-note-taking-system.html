          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cue Column:</strong> A narrow left-hand column for writing
            down questions, keywords, or cues that trigger recall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Summary Section:</strong> A space at the bottom for
            summarizing the main ideas of the notes after reviewing them.
