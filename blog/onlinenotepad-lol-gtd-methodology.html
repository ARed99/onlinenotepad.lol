        <h2>What is GTD?</h2>
        <p>
          GTD is a time management method that encourages you to capture all
          tasks, ideas, and commitments in an organized way, allowing you to
          focus on executing tasks rather than remembering them. The five key
          stages of GTD are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Capture:</strong> Collect all tasks and ideas into a trusted
            system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clarify:</strong> Process what these items mean and decide
            what to do with them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organize:</strong> Sort tasks into appropriate categories.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reflect:</strong> Review your tasks regularly to stay on
            track.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Engage:</strong> Take action on your organized tasks.</li>
        </ol>

          item entails.

          them easily when needed.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Reflect</h3>
        <p>
          Set aside time each week to reflect on your tasks using

          reflection can guide adjustments to your task list, ensuring you're
