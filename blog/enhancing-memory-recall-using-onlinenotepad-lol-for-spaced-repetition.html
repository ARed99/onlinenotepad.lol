          <h2>Understanding Spaced Repetition</h2>
          <p>
            Spaced repetition is a learning technique that involves reviewing
            information at increasing intervals over time. This method leverages
            the psychological spacing effect, which enhances long-term memory
            retention. By systematically revisiting material, learners can
            solidify their understanding and improve recall. OnlineNotepad.lol
            serves as an excellent tool to implement spaced repetition in your
            study routine.
