          <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to recognize,
            understand, and manage our own emotions while also being aware of
            the emotions of others. Enhancing EI is essential for personal
            growth, effective communication, and building healthy relationships.

            The Importance of Self-Reflection in Developing Emotional
            Intelligence
          </h2>
          <p>
            Self-reflection plays a crucial role in enhancing emotional
            intelligence. By taking time to reflect on our thoughts, feelings,
            and behaviors, we can gain insights into our emotional patterns and
            triggers. This awareness allows us to manage our responses and
            improve our interactions with others.
