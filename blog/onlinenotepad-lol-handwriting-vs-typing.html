        <h2>The Cognitive Science of Handwriting</h2>
        <p>
          Research indicates that handwriting engages the brain in a way that
          enhances learning and retention. Key benefits include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Memory Retention:</strong> Writing by hand requires more
            cognitive effort, which can lead to better retention of information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Understanding Concepts:</strong> The slower pace of
            handwriting allows for deeper processing and understanding of the
            material.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creativity Boost:</strong> Handwriting encourages creative
            thinking, as the physical act can stimulate new ideas.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Speed:</strong> Typing is generally faster, allowing for

            organized, searched, and edited, making retrieval straightforward.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Typing facilitates real-time
            collaboration, enabling multiple users to work on documents
            simultaneously.
