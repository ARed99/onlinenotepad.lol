        <h2>What is Gamification in Education?</h2>
        <p>
          Gamification refers to applying game-like elements—such as point
          scoring, leaderboards, and challenges—to non-game environments. In
          education, it’s an effective way to engage students, motivate
          learning, and increase retention of information. By incorporating
          gamified elements into tools like OnlineNotepad.lol, learners can find
          the act of taking notes and organizing study materials more
          interactive and rewarding.
