          <h2>What is the Feynman Technique?</h2>
          <p>
            The Feynman Technique, named after physicist Richard Feynman, is a
            learning method that emphasizes understanding through teaching. The
            core idea is that if you can't explain a concept simply, you don't
            understand it well enough. This technique involves four key steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Choose a concept you want to learn.</li>
            <li>Explain the concept in simple terms.</li>
            <li>
              Identify gaps in your understanding and revisit the source
              material.
            </li>
            <li>Review and simplify your explanation further.</li>
          </ol>
