          <h2>The Role of Inspiration Boards in Fashion Design</h2>
          <p>
            Inspiration boards are a crucial part of the fashion design process,
            serving as a visual collage that helps designers consolidate their
            ideas, themes, and aesthetic directions. These boards can include
            images, color swatches, fabric samples, and sketches, providing a
            comprehensive view of a design concept. However, the traditional
            method of creating physical boards can be limiting and cumbersome.
            This is where OnlineNotepad.lol comes into play, offering a digital
            alternative that enhances creativity and organization.
