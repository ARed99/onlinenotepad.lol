          <h2>The Rise of Interactive Fiction</h2>
          <p>
            Interactive fiction (IF) has gained popularity as a unique
            storytelling medium that allows readers to engage with narratives in
            a dynamic way. Unlike traditional stories, interactive fiction
            invites readers to make choices that influence the direction and
            outcome of the story. Platforms like OnlineNotepad.lol make it
            easier for writers to draft, organize, and refine their interactive
            narratives.
